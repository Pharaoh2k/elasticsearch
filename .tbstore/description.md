This is the official release of the crowdfunded thirty bees Elastic Search module. This module allows you to use 
Elastic Search with your thirty bees site. To use this module you need to install your own Elastic Search instance 
either on your server or a server dedicated just to searching. Then you can connect this module to the search server 
and use it with your site. This module comes with templates that are compatible with Warehouse, Panda, Transformer, 
and the default thirty bees theme.
